# MozMEAO incident response guide

Stay cool, take a deep breath. We'll solve this problem together, and this guide is here to help.

This document does not describe the on-call or escalation process, but rather the process we use once an issue has been identified.

## Declaring an incident and the incident leader (IL) role

The incident leader (IL) is a Mozilla staff member that serves as the primary point of contact and coordinator for an incident. This person may have been called by the moc, or just noticed that a service is broken.

When an incident occurs, the IL posts messages in the primary developer IRC channel for the service stating:

- an incident has been declared and a few words about the incident
- "I am the incident leader"
- the main IRC channel for communication
    - we'll call this the *incident comms channel* in this document
- a Vidyo chat room if needed
- finally, decide if you need to notify the appropriate engineers that can help resolve the issue
    - TODO: link to on-call process

Our primary service channels are:
- `#mdndev`
- `#www`
- `#basket`
- `#snippets`
- `#sumodev`

Smaller Mozilla sites/service messages can be posted in `#mozmeao`.


***Security incidents must not be discussed on IRC.***

Example incident declaration:

```
metadave>  MDN is experiencing an outage                          12:00 PM
metadave>  I am declaring an incident and am incident leader      12:00 PM
metadave>  updates will be posted in the #mdndev channel          12:00 PM
metadave>  ping jwhitlock rjohnson there is an urgent MDN outage  12:00 PM
metadave>  please meet in my Vidyo room                           12:01 PM
```
    
> it's helpful to include a short description of the incident when mentioning IRC users. For example `ping metadave` is not very useful when it appears as a notification on my phone, but `ping metadave MDN infra is on fire` lets me know that the issue is urgent without having to open my IRC app.

### Passing the baton

Incident response can be stressful, and it's ok if you need a break. In the incident comms channel, you can hand off the IL role to someone else if they agree. The new IL should acknowlege that they are now IL.

Example:

```
metadave>  I need a few minutes of downtime                        4:01 PM
metadave> jgmize has agreed to take over IL                        4:01 PM
jgmize> Confirmed, I am now IL                                     4:01 PM
```

## Communications

Notify the following IRC channels:

- `#mozmeao`
- `#meao-infra`
- `#moc`
    - the moc maintains an incident respone guide [here](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SECURITY/Incident+Response#IncidentResponse-IncidentResponseTemplate).

Example:

```
metadave>  there is an MDN outage, we are working in #mdndev       12:05 PM
metadave>  I'll post an update here within the next 30 minutes     12:05 PM
```

- Notify the appropriate lead(s) for the product.

For extended outages, a bug should be filed and the #moc should be notified to update the status page.

> Don't post phone numbers in IRC!

### Frequency of updates

For outages, status should be posted every 30 minutes *or less* in the incident channel.

## Incident timeline

To help write an incident report, it's very useful to include a `TL:` prefix on IRC messages when logging important events and decisions.

Example:

```
metadave> TL: listeners appear to missing from the MDN ELB          3:11 PM
            ...
            ...
metadave> TL: listeners have been manually added back to the ELB    4:05 PM
metadave> TL: listeners have been overwritten by K8s                4:10 PM
```


## Incident resolution

When an incident has been resolved, post a message in the incident comms channel stating so:

```
metadave> TL: the MDN outage has been resolved                      5:00 PM
metadave> we'll followup with an incident report                    5:00 PM
```

## Incident report

Please add an [incident report](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52265112) to Mana within 48 hours of the incident.

## Incident response tips

- Take a few deep breaths, you're doing great!
- Stay positive, the IL is relying on teamwork to get things working again.
    - Give props to team members who are "fighting the good fight".
- Bring some humor to help break the tension.
- Don't distract the team by being critical, such as "this is poorly designed, it should be implemented with XYZ". This doesn't help us resolve the issue we're working on *right now*, but may be helpful as part of a postmortem.
